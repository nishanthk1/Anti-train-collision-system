# Radar-based-anti-train-collision-system

This repository contains code examples for different aspects of a radar-based anti-train collision system. The examples cover signal processing, user interface, and track detection using radar data.

## Signal Processing and Basic Target Detection

The code example demonstrates the basics of target detection using radar signal processing techniques. It simulates radar data, performs range-Doppler processing, and applies thresholding to identify potential targets. Please note that this example is simplified and serves as a starting point.

## Visualization and User Interface

The code example showcases the creation of a simple graphical user interface (GUI) for visualizing radar data and detected targets. It uses GUI libraries to create a window with a radar-like display area where targets are visualized as points. The GUI is basic and illustrative, meant to convey the idea of data visualization.

## Track Detection

The code example outlines a basic approach to track detection using radar data. It simulates radar data along a straight track pattern, performs range-Doppler processing, and uses thresholding and peak detection to identify potential track segments. This example is simplified and may not work effectively in all scenarios.

## Note

Please run the Visualization and User Interface code in python interpreter/compiler with tkinter
